				<p><img class ="jonSnow" alt ="jonSnow" src="assets/images/profilepicture.jpg">
				Jon Snow is the bastard child of Ned Stark, the late Lord of Winterfell. Having taken the Black and committed himself to the Night's Watch, Jon has thrown his all into protecting the realm from the true dangers beyond the Wall, earning himself friends and enemies from within and without.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Jon, inheriting his father's will to do the right thing and lead with honor, has proven himself reliable and capable under duress, and has recently been elected the new Commander of the Watch following the tragic death of Commander Mormont. Jon knows he will do a great job leading the Night's Watch, and that his brothers will have his back. And his front. What could go wrong?
